LiveScript syntax highlighting for Komodo Edit
==============================================

Syntax highlighting in Komodo Edit for LiveScript, the successor of CoffeeScript.
Got string and regular expression parsing decent - they drive me nuts in most
highlighters I've come across.

Known issues:
- Operators don't highlight atm, in favour of dashes being coloured in
  keywords. Fix coming.

Please do contribute refinements!
