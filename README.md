LiveScript syntax highlighting for Komodo Edit
==============================================

Syntax highlighting in Komodo Edit for LiveScript, the successor of CoffeeScript.

I love using Vim for LiveScript, and I also love Komodo. This
highlighter works better than the vim one now, for my use cases anyway.
So expect more LiveScript-utils for Komodo coming up. 

Known issues:
- It's still fresh of the press and not extensively tested. It may or
  may not blow up your computer.
- haven't looked in to indent hinting yet - it's only highlighting
- regular expression parsing is as lousy as all other (any language) syntax highlighters atm. Expect fix.

All you need is the "livescript_language*.xpi" in the root directory, if
you don't wanna modify it.
