LiveScript syntax highlighting for Komodo Edit
==============================================

Syntax highlighting in Komodo Edit for LiveScript, the successor of CoffeeScript.
Got string and regular expression parsing decent - they drive me nuts in most
highlighters I've come across.

Known issues:
- dot-identifiers with same name as keywords still highlight like
  keywords.
- haven't looked in to indent hinting yet - it's only highlighting

Please do contribute refinements!
